Tic Tac Toe rules:<br>
<br>
X always goes first.<br>
<br>
Players cannot play on a played position<br>
<br>
Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either: 
  * One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
  * All nine squares are filled.<br>
<br>
If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.<br>
<br>
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
